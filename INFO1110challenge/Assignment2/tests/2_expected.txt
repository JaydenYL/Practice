You are now at: Stairway.
There is nothing here.

>> You move east, to Goose Heaven.

Dog is trying to catch you!
But your presence still terrifies them...


[ ]-[x]


You are now at: Goose Heaven.
A dog is barking at you!
The path to freedom is clear. You can FLEE this place.

>> You slip past the dastardly Goosechasers and run off into the wilderness! Freedom at last!
