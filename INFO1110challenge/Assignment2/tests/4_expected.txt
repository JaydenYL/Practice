You are now at: Stairway.
There is nothing here.

>> You move east, to Goose Heaven.

Dog is trying to catch you!
But your presence still terrifies them...

You are now at: Goose Heaven.
A dog is barking at you!
The path to freedom is clear. You can FLEE this place.

>> You sneak up behind your quarry and honk with all the force of a really angry airhorn! HONK!
Dog is spooked! They flee immediately!

None can stand against the power of the goose!
